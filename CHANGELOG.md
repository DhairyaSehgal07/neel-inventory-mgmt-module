# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

### [0.3.15](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.14...v0.3.15) (2026-04-06)

### Added

* **Fabrics table – GSM calculated** – Column for calculated GSM (Kg) on the fabrics list.
* **Analytics – width × strength stock matrix** – Matrix of total remaining length (m) and roll counts by fabric width × strength (`GET /api/fabrics/analytics/width-strength-matrix`); `WidthStrengthStockMatrix` on the analytics page.
* **Analytics – stock cover, aging, consumption, remnants** – Charts on `/analytics` backed by:
  * `GET /api/fabrics/analytics/stock-cover-by-sku` – months of cover per roll from balance history over a configurable window (lowest cover first).
  * `GET /api/fabrics/analytics/open-in-use-aging` – calendar aging for OPEN and IN_USE rolls from last fabric history (or `updatedAt` fallback).
  * `GET /api/fabrics/analytics/consumption-trend` – consumption by day/week/month with optional split by width, strength, or assignee.
  * `GET /api/fabrics/analytics/partial-roll-remnant` – histogram of partial rolls (remnants) by remaining length buckets.
* **`fabricAnalytics.ts`** – `liveFabricStockWhere()` for live-inventory scope (positive length, not rejected/traded) and shared types for analytics payloads.

### Changed

* **Analytics UI** – Shadcn chart components and Recharts for analytics visualizations (consumption trend, aging, stock cover, remnants, width × strength matrix).

### [0.3.14](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.13...v0.3.14) (2026-03-28)

### Added

* **Fabrics – Get reports** – Fabrics list toolbar includes a "Get reports" control that opens a dialog to download a **PDF** or **Excel** report per status category (All, Packed, In Use, Closed, Open, Rejected, Traded).
* **Fabric list PDF** – Client-side PDF (`@react-pdf/renderer`) with the same columns as the fabrics table (excluding actions): fabric code (full code), date, type, strength, width, length, vendor, location, GSM, net weight, status, assigned to. Rows match the selected category and are sorted like the list. PDF opens in a new tab.
* **Fabric list Excel** – `.xlsx` export via `xlsx` (SheetJS) with the same dataset and columns as the PDF; title and generated timestamp rows; file downloads as `Fabric-report-{category}-{date}.xlsx`.
* **`fabric-list-report-shared.ts`** – Shared column definitions and `prepareFabricsForCategoryReport` / `buildFabricReportCellValues` so PDF and Excel stay aligned.

### Changed

* **Dependencies** – Added `xlsx` for spreadsheet export.

### [0.3.13](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.12...v0.3.13) (2026-03-18)

### Changed

* **Fabrics UI – width in cm** – Width is displayed and labeled in cm everywhere: fabrics list (table column and width filter), fabric detail page (nominal and current width), new fabric form (label, validation message, comment), and edit fabric form (width, width initial, width current).
* **PATCH fabric** – Fabric code on update now uses `generateFabricCode` (same format as create: id-type-strength-width-vendor-sequence-date).

### [0.3.12](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.11...v0.3.12) (2026-03-12)

### Added

* **Fabric edit – location** – Optional Location (Area, Floor) fields on the fabric edit form. PATCH `/api/fabrics/[id]` accepts `locations` (or `locationsPerFabric`); existing fabric locations are replaced with the payload. GET fabric includes `locations`.

### Changed

* **New fabric form** – Always sends `locationsPerFabric` in the create payload (no conditional omit).
* **dbConnect** – Removed admin user seeding from `dbConnect()`. Connection only ensures DB connect and throws on failure. Seeding is done via `npx prisma db seed` only.

### [0.3.11](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.9...v0.3.11) (2026-03-05)

### Changed

* **Fabric edit form** – Width field is now a free numeric input in cm instead of a width dropdown. Edit page no longer fetches fabric widths; submit sends `fabricWidthValue` (meters) for find-or-create. Width (cm) label and validation (required, valid number) retained.

### Added

* **Seed** – New "Stores" user (Supervisor role, mobile 9876902360) seeded with full permissions.

### [0.3.9](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.8...v0.3.9) (2026-03-02)

### Changed

* **Fabrics table** – First column shows Fabric Code instead of ID. Pagination: default page size 50, "Rows per page" selector (10, 50, 100) and clearer "Showing X to Y of Z fabrics" in the footer.
* **Single-fabric PDF** – Larger font sizes for fabric code, labels, values, and status badge; label "FABRIC LENGTH" shortened to "LENGTH" for layout.

### [0.3.8](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.7...v0.3.8) (2026-03-02)

### Changed

* **Fabric code format** – Fabric codes now include fabric id and sequence for uniqueness: format is `{id}-{typeName}-{strengthName}-{widthValue}-{vendor}-{sequence}-{dateStr}`. Create flow uses a temporary code on insert, then updates with the final fabric code and product URL after the record exists.

### [0.3.7](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.6...v0.3.7) (2026-02-24)

### Features

* **Assign fabric** – Optional `assignTo` field on Fabric model. Assign-fabric dialog on fabric detail page: select process (e.g. Calendaring 1–4, Rejection, Trading) and POST `/api/fabrics/[id]/assign`. Requires FABRIC_UPDATE.
* **Update fabric balance** – Update-balance dialog on fabric detail page: set closing balance (quantity). POST `/api/fabrics/[id]/update-fabric-quantity` updates `fabricLengthCurrent` and sets status to OPEN if quantity > 0, CLOSED if 0. Requires FABRIC_UPDATE.

### Changed

* **Fabric detail** – Assign fabric and Update balance actions on fabric detail page.
* **Fabrics list** – Columns and filters updated for assign/balance flows.

### Fixed

* **Update fabric quantity API** – Zod 4: use `message` for `z.coerce.number()` validation (replaced `required_error` / `invalid_type_error`).

### [0.3.6](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.5...v0.3.6) (2026-02-24)

### Features

* **Single-fabric PDF** – New `Single-Fabric-Roll-Pdf` component using `@react-pdf/renderer`: generates A4 PDF with QR code (product URL) and fabric code for a fabric roll. `getSingleFabricPdfBlob()` builds the PDF client-side for download or print.
* **Print fabric** – Fabrics table row actions: added Print button (Printer icon) that opens the single-fabric PDF in a new tab. Row actions refactored into `FabricRowActions` with tooltips (View, Print, Edit, Delete) and loading state while generating PDF.

### Changed

* **Fabric form labels** – New fabric form: Width label "Width (m)" → "Width (cm)"; GSM labels "GSM (observed)" → "GSM (observed Kg)", "GSM (calculated)" → "GSM (calculated Kg)".
* **Dependencies** – Added `@react-pdf/renderer` for PDF generation.

### [0.3.5](https://github.com/DhairyaSehgal07/neel-inventory-mgmt-module/compare/v0.3.4...v0.3.5) (2026-02-24)

### Features

* **Badge component** – New `Badge` UI component (shadcn-style) for status and labels.

### Changed

* **Fabric type/strength forms** – First-letter capitalisation on name fields in settings forms (fabric type, fabric strength).

### [0.3.4](///compare/v0.3.3...v0.3.4) (2026-02-24)

### Features

* **Fabric status** – Added optional `status` field to Fabric model. New fabrics are created with status "READY TO USE". Status is shown in the fabrics list table and on the fabric detail page.
* **Fabrics list order** – GET /api/fabrics now returns fabrics sorted by id ascending (oldest to latest); list page displays in that order.
* **Belt code frequency** – Fabric/belt code frequency in generated codes now starts from 1 (was 0) for both create and update.
* **Truncate fabrics script** – New `pnpm run truncate-fabrics` script and `scripts/truncate-fabrics.ts` to truncate the fabrics table and restart identity.

### Changed

* **Fabric width in API** – Create and update fabric APIs now use `fabricWidthValue` only (find-or-create by value); removed `fabricWidthId` from schema and routes.
* **Fabric schema** – Create fabric schema uses `fabricWidthValue`; PATCH resolves width by value and find-or-create.

### [0.3.3](///compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3) (2026-02-13)

### Features

* **Fabrics list** – New `/fabrics` page with shadcn + TanStack table: search, pagination, view (eye), edit, delete. GET /api/fabrics to list fabrics; PATCH/DELETE /api/fabrics/[id] for update and delete.
* **Fabric detail** – Detail page at `/fabrics/[id]` with product info and fabric code; back link to list.
* **Fabric edit** – Edit page at `/fabrics/[id]/edit` with form and PATCH integration.
* **Fabric code in detail** – Fabric code shown in fabric detail view.
* **QR code URL** – New fabrics get `qrCode` pointing to `/fabrics/[id]` (was `/products/[id]`). Add-fabric form and dashboard link to `/fabrics/new`; redirect to `/fabrics/[id]` after create.

### Removed

* **Products detail** – Removed `/products/[id]` page in favor of `/fabrics/[id]`.
* **Serial number column** – Removed S.No column from fabrics table; ID column serves as identifier.

### [0.3.2](///compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2) (2026-02-08)

### Features

* **Fabric code** – Backend-generated `fabricCode` on fabric create (format: fabricType-fabricStrength-fabricWidth-supplier-netWeight-date). Added `fabricCode` and `fabricDate` to Prisma Fabric model.
* **Fabric types settings** – Full CRUD with API integration: list (GET), create (POST), update (PATCH), delete (DELETE). Data table with search, pagination, loaders (Spinner), toasts (Sonner), error state with retry. Form with Zod validation and first-letter capitalisation before submit. Delete confirmation via AlertDialog.
* **Fabric strengths settings** – Full CRUD page: table, form, API integration, loaders, toasts, error handling, AlertDialog delete confirmation. First-letter capitalisation on strength name in form.
* **Fabric widths settings** – Full CRUD page: table, form (numeric value), API integration, loaders, toasts, error handling, AlertDialog delete confirmation.
* **Toaster** – Sonner Toaster added to app Providers (richColors, top-right, closeButton) for global toast notifications.
* **Add Fabric form** – Fabric type, strength, and width dropdowns fetch options from `/api/fabric-types`, `/api/fabric-strengths`, and `/api/fabric-widths`. Loading state and disabled selects while fetching; error toasts on failed load.

### Changed

* **Delete confirmation** – Replaced native `confirm()` with AlertDialog on fabric types, strengths, and widths settings pages.
* **Fabric API** – POST create now validates and resolves type/strength/width, generates `fabricCode`, and persists `fabricDate`.
